      "WHEREAS the University in Cambridge for several years past has\n",
      "suffered much inconvenience, and the interest of letters no small detriment, from the variety of Latin and Greek Grammars used by the students, in consequence of that diversity, to which, under different instructors, they have been accụstomed in their preparatory course ; to promote,\n",
      "so far as may be, the cause of Literature, by preventing those evils in future, the Government of the University, on due consideration of the subject, has thought it expedient to request all instructors of Youth, who may\n",
      "resort to Cambridge for education, to adopt  Adam's Latin Grammar,\n",
      "and the  Gloucester Greek Grammar,\" with reference to such pupils, as\n",
      "Books singularly calculated for the improvement of students in these lan.\n",
      "guages. The University has no wish to recommend, much less to dictate,\n",
      "10 any other institution, but only to facilitate the acquisition of Literature,\n",
      "by promoting uniformity within itself. These being the Grammars which\n",
      "will be used at this College by all classes, admitted after the present year,\n",
      "it seems necessary, to prevent future difficulty, by giving this public and\n",
      "timely notice ; for though a knowledge of the Grammar is not at present\n",
      "made indispensably necessary to admission into the University, yet every\n",
      "Scholar who may be accepted after the present Commencement without\n",
      "such kvowledge, will be required immediately to form a radical and inti.\n",
      "mate acquaintance with them, as po student will be permitted at the clas\n",

      "PREFACE\n",
      "TO THE\n",
      "FOURTH EDITION.\n",
      "THE compiler was first led, at an early period of life, to\n",
      "think of composing this Book, by observing the hurtful effects of teaching boys Grammar Rules in Latin verse, which\n",
      "they did not understand ; while they were ignorant, not only\n",
      "of the principles of that language, but also of those of their\n",
      "mother tongue. Experience has since afforded him the most\n",
      "convincing proofs of the impropriety of this practice; and\n",
      "his opinion has been still further confirmed by perusing the\n",
      "the writings of the old Grammarians, and of the most eminent among the moderns. The old Grammarians, Charisius,\n",
      "Diomedes, Priscianus, Probus, Donatus, Servius, Victorinus,\n",
      "Augustinus, Cassiodorus, Macrobius, Beda, Alcuinus,* &c.\n",
      "have no verse rules; and so in latter times, Perotte, Manutius, Erasmus, Valerius, Buchanan, Milton, &c. Nicholas\n",
      "Perotte was one of the chief restorers of learning in the\n",
      "fifteenth century. He died Archbishop of Siponto, in 1480.\n",
      "The compiler bas a copy of the first edition of his Grammar, printed at Brescia, anno 1474. It is composed by way\n",
      "of question and answer, but without any verse rules. --Soon\n",
      "after the invention of printing, and perhaps before, for the\n",
      "compiler has not been able to ascertain the precise period,\n",
      "the custom was introduced of expressing the principles of\n",
      "almost every art and science in Latin and Greek verse.\n",
      "The rules of Logic, and even the aphorisms of Hippocrates,\n",
      "were taught in this manner. Among the versifiers of Latin\n",
      "* Terentianus Maurus, a learned Grammarian, by birth on African,\n",
      "soho is supposeil to have lived under Trajan, and wrote in verse, treats\n",
      "only of poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Grammar Despauter and Lily were the most conspicuous.\n",
      "The first complete edition of Despauter's Grammar was\n",
      "printed at Cologne, anno 1522; his Syntax had been published\n",
      "anno 1509. Lily was made first master of St. Paul's school\n",
      "in London, by Dr. Colet, its founder, anno 1510 ; so that he\n",
      "was contemporary with Despauter. His Grammar was appointed, by an act which is still in force, to be taught in the\n",
      "established schools of England. Various attempts were afterwards made by different authors ; as, Sanctius, Alvarus,\n",
      "Scioppius, Kirkwood, Watt, Ruddiman, &c. to improve on the\n",
      "plan of Despauter and Lily ; but with little success. The\n",
      "truth is, it seems impracticable to express with sufficient\n",
      "perspicuity the Principles of Grammar in Latin verse\"; and\n",
      "at appears strange, that when scholastic jargon is exploded\n",
      "from elementary books on other sciences, it should be retained by public authority, where it ought never to have\n",
      "been admitted, in Latin Grammars for children. But such\n",
      "is the force of habit and attachment to established modes,\n",
      "that we go on in the use of them, without thinking whether\n",
      "they be founded in reason or not. When there are a\n",
      "great many exceptions to a general rule, whatever can assist the memory is no doubt useful. On this account the\n",
      "principal rules for the genders of pouns, &c. are here subjoined, for local reasons, from Ruddiman's Grammar ; although many of them are by no means adapted to the capasity of boys; and more of them are inserted, in compliance\n",
      "with the opinion of others, than the compiler judges necessary. They are printed at the end of the Book ; and such\n",
      "as choose it, may have Lily's rules, Watt's rules, or any\n",
      "other substituted in their place.\n",
      "The authors of the Nouvelle Methode, or Port Royal\n",
      "Grammar in France, judging it as absurd to teach Latin by\n",
      "rules in Latin verse, as to teach Greek by rules in Greek\n",
      "verse, or Hebrew by rules in Hebrew, composed the rules\n",
      "of Latin Grammar in French verse. Some authors in England, as, Clarke, Phillips, &c. have imitated their example.\n",
      "But this plan has not in either country been much followed.\n",
      "Nothing can be more uncouth than such versification. So\n",
      "that Latin rules, on the whole, seem preferable.However\n",
      "this may be, the following remarks concerning the method\n",
      "of teaching Latin, it is hoped will not be deemed improper.\n",
      "When the learner is once master of the inflexion of nouns\n",
      "and verbs, he should be exercised in getting by heart words\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and phrases, while at the same time he is employed in reading some easy author, and in turning plain sentences from\n",
      "English into Latin. The sooner he can be brought to write\n",
      "part of his exercises, the better ; but he should never be\n",
      "obliged to get Grammar rules in Latin verse, till he is capable of understanding them by himself; because, although\n",
      "the teacher may explain them, the scholar will soon forget\n",
      "the interpretation, and repeat the words merely by rote,\n",
      "without attending to their meaning. Nor should he be forced to get rules in Latin verse, which may be remembered\n",
      "equally well in English prose. Rules in verse are only\n",
      "useful when they assist the memory ; as when there is a\n",
      "number of exceptions from a general rule, where alone they\n",
      "are indeed of advantage : and even here, perhaps, any\n",
      "chime of words might answer the purpose as well as Latin\n",
      "hexameters. It is of importance, when the rule is long,\n",
      "that the learner be accustomed to repeat no more of it than\n",
      "is strictly applicable to the word or phrase in question.\n",
      "The repetition of the whole is an useless waste of time. The great object ought to be, to bring the learner, in as\n",
      "short a time as possible, to join without hesitation an adjectiye with a substantive in any case, number, or degree of\n",
      "comparison ; and in like manner to touch upon any part of\n",
      "a verb, and to tell readily by what case any adjective, verb,\n",
      "or preposition is followed. This facility practice alone can\n",
      "teach, and the method of acquiring it must in all languages\n",
      "be much the same.\n",
      "The niceties of construction, the figures of Syntax, and\n",
      "the other parts of Grammar, should be occasionally taught,\n",
      "as the learner proceeds in reading the more difficult authors.\n",
      "- As the ancient Romans joined the Grammar of their own\n",
      "language with that of the Greek ; so we ought to connect\n",
      "the study of English Grammar with that of the Latin. And\n",
      "when the learner properly understands Latin Grammar, he\n",
      "ought to join with it the study of the Greek; the knowledge\n",
      "of both these languages being requisite for the thorough understanding of the English. This is the practice in England and other countries, were the best Greek and Latin\n",
      "scholars are formed. It is particularly necessary in Scotland\n",
      "to pay attention to the English in conjunction with the Latin,\n",

      "DIPHTHONGS.\n",
      "A diphthong, is two vowels joined in one sound.\n",

      "vowel comes after g, 9, or s, as in lingua, qui, suadeo;\n",
      "where the two vowels are not reckoned a diphthong, because\n",
      "the sound of the u vanishes, or is little heard.\n",
      "Words consisting of one syllable are called Monosyllables ;\n",
      "of two, Dissyllables ; and of more than two, Polysyllables.\n",
      "But all words of more than one syllable are commonly\n",

      "ENGLISH NOUNS.\n",
      "In English, nouns have only one case, namely, the genitive, or possessive case, which is formed from the noun, by\n",
      "adding an s, with an apostrophe, or mark to separate it ; as,\n",
      "John's book, the same with the book of John. It was formerly written Johnis book.\n",
      "Some have thought the 's a contraction for his ; but improperly : because, instead of\n",
      "the woman's book, we cannot say, the woman his book. Others have imagined, and\n",
      "with more justness, that by the addition of the 's the substantive is changed into a possessive adjective\n",
      "When the noun ends in s, the sign of the possessive case is sometimes not added; as\n",
      "for righteousness sake ; and never to the plural number ending in $; as, on eagles\n",
      "wings. Perhaps it would be better in the plural when it ends in s, always to use the\n",
      "particle and not the possessive forma; as, on ihe wings of eagles. Both the sign and the\n",
      "preposition seem sometimes to be used; as a soldier of the king's : but here are two\n",
      "possessives ; for it means, one of the soldiers of the king\n",
      "* A singular noun, in English, is made plural by adding to\n",
      "it s, or, for the sake of sound, es ; as, king, kings ; church,\n",
      "churches; brush, brushes ; witness, witnesses ; fox, foxes ; leaf,\n",
      "leaves ; in which last and in many others, f is also turned\n",
      "into v, to make the pronunciation easier.\n",
      "Several plurals are formed by adding en ; as ox, oxen.\n",
      "Of these some are contracted, or interpose a letter on acmen, &c. for brotheren, sowen, &c. Instead of kine we now\n",

      "Nouns in y change y into ie ; as, cherry, cherries; city,\n",
      "cities. Cherry's, city's, &c. are in the possessive case.\n",

      "Such are the names of wild beasts, birds, fishes, and insects, in which the distinction of sex is either not easily\n",
      "discerned, or seldom attended to. Thus, passer, a sparrow, is masculine, because nouns in er are masculine ; so\n",
      "aquila, an eagle, is feminine, because nouns in d, of the first\n",

      "Obs. 2. A proper name, for the most part, follows the\n",
      "gender of the general name under which it is comprehended.\n",
      "Thus, the names of months, winds, rivers and mountains,\n",
      "are masculine ; because mensis, ventus, mons, and fluvius, are\n",

      "wind ; hic Africus, the south-west wind ; hic Tibēris, the\n",
      "river Tiber; hic Othrys, a hill in Thessaly. But many of\n",
      "these follow the gender of their termination ; as, hæc Matrona, the river Marne in France ; hæc Ætna, a mountain\n",
      "in Sicily ; hoc Sõracte, a hill in Italy.\n",
      "In like manner, the names of countries, towns, trees,\n",

      "That part of grammar which teaches to put words rightly together in sentences, is called Syntax or Construction.\n",
      "Words in sentences have a twofold relation to one another ; namely, that of Concord or Agreement ; and that of\n",

      "Concord, is when one word agrees with another in some\n",

      "1. In every sentence there must be a verb and a nominative expressed or understood.\n",

      "4. The genitive is governed by a substantive noun expressed or understood.\n",
      "5. The dative is governed by adjectives and verbs.\n",
      "6. The accusative is governed by an active verb, or by a\n",
      "preposition ; or is placed before the infinitive.\n",
      "7. The vocative stands by itself, or has an interjection\n",
      "joined with it.\n",
      "8. The ablative is governed by a preposition expressed\n",
      "or understood.\n",
      "9. The infinitive is governed by some verb or adjective.,\n",
      "10. The genitive or possessive case in English always depends on some noun; and the objective or accusative case\n",
      "is put after a verb active or a preposition.\n",
      "All sentences are either SIMPLE or ComPOUND.\n",

      "III. ANALYSIS AND TRANSLATION.\n",
      "The difficulty of translating either from English into\n",
      "Latin, or from Latin into English, arises in a great measure\n",
      "from the different arrangement of words, which takes place\n",
      "in the two languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1897\n",
      "· In Latin the various terminations of nouns, and the inffection of adjectives and verbs, point out the relation of one\n",
      "word to another, in whatever order they are placed. But\n",
      "in English the agreement and government of words can only\n",
      "be determined irom the particular part of the sentence in\n",
      "which they stand. Thus in Latin, we can either say, Alexander vicit Darium, or Darium vicit Alexander, or Alexander\n",
      "Darium vicit, or Darium Alexander vicit ; and in each of\n",
      "these the sense is equally obvious : but in English we can\n",
      "only say Alexander conquered Darius. This variety of arrangement in Latin gives it a great advantage over the English, not only in point of energy and vivacity of expressions\n",
      "but also in point of harmony. We sometimes, indeed, for\n",
      "the sake of variety and force, imitate in English the inversion of words which takes place in Latin ; as, Him the Eternal hurl'd, Milton. Whom ye ignorantly worship, him de...\n",
      "clare I unto you. But this is chiefly to be used in poetry.\n",
      "With regard to the proper order of words to be observed\n",
      "in translating from English into Latin, the only certain rule\n",
      "which can be given, is to imitate the CLASSICS.\n",
      "The order of words in sentences is said to be either sim- ,\n",
      "ple or artificial; or, as it is otherwise expressed, either na..\n",
      "Lural or oratorial.\n",
      "The Simplę or Natural order is, when the words of a senotence are placed one after another, according to the natural order of syntax.\n",
      "Artificial or Oratorial order is, when words are so arranged, as to render them most striking, or most agreeable to the\n",
      "ear.\n",
      "- All Latin writers use an arrangement of words, which\n",
      "appears to us more or less artificial, because different from\n",
      "our own, although to them it was as natural as ours is to us.\n",
      "In order therefore to render any Latin author into English,\n",
      "we must first reduce the words in Latin to the order of English, which is called the Analysis or Resolution of sentences.\n",
      "It is only practice that can teach one to do this with readi.\n",
      "ness. However, to a beginner, the observation of the following rule may be of advantage.\n",
      "Take first the words which serve to introduce the sentence, or shew its dependence on what went before ; next\n",
      "the nominative, together with the words which it agrees\n",
      "with or governs; then, the verb and adverbs joined with it;\n",
      "and lastly, the cases which the verb governs, together with\n",

      "adapted to different sorts of composition, and to different\n",
      "subjects ; together with the various turns of thought and\n",
      "expression which writers employ, or what are called the figures of words and of thought ; or the Figures of Rhetoric..\n",
      "IV. DIFFERENT KINDS OF STYLE.\n",
      "The kinds of Style (genera dicendi) are commonly reckoned three ; the low, (humile, submissuin, tenue); the middle,\n",
      "(medium, temperatum, ornatum, floridum); and the sublime,\n",
      "sublime, grande.)\n",
      "But besides these, there are various other characters of\n",
      "style ; as, the diffuse and concise ; the feeble and nervous ;\n",
      "the simple and affected, &c.\n",
      "There are different kinds of style adapted to different\n",
      "subjects and to different kinds of composition ; the style of\n",
      "the Pulpit, of the Bar, and of Popular Assemblies; the\n",
      "style of History, and of its various branches, Annals, Memoirs or Commentaries, and Lives ; the style of Philosophy, of Dialogue or Colloquial discourse, of Epistles, and\n",
      "Romance, &c.\n",
      "There is also a style peculiar to certain writers, called\n",
      "their Manner ; as, the style of Cicero, of Livy, of Sallust,\n",
      "&c.\n",
      "But what deserves particular attention is, the difference\n",
      "between the style of poetry and of prose. As the poets in.\n",

      "a manner paint what they describe, they employ various\n",
      "epithets, repetitions, and turns of expression, which are not\n",
      "admitted in prose.\n",
      "The first virtue of style (virtus orationis) is perspicuity.\n",
      "or that it be easily understood. . This requires, in the choice\n",
      "of the words, 1. Purity, in opposition to barbarous, obsolete\n",
      "or new coined words, and to errors in Syntax : 2. Propriety, or the selection of the best expressions, in opposition to\n",
      "vulgarisms or low expressions : 3. Precision, in opposition\n",
      "to superfluity of words or a loose style.\n",
      "The things chiefly to be attended to in the structure of a\n",
      "sentence, or in the disposition of its parts, are, 1. Clearness,\n",
      "in opposition to ambiguity and obscurity: 2. Unity and\n",
      "Strength, in opposition to an unconnected, intricate and feeble\n",
      "sentence : 3. Harmony, or musical arrangement, in opposition to harshness of sound.\n",
      "The most common defects of style (vitia orationis) are\n",
      "distinguished by various names :\n",
      "1. A BARBARISM is when a foreign or strange word\n",
      "is made use of; as, croftus, for agellus ; rigorosus, for rigidus or severus ; alterare, for mutare, &c. Or when the\n",
      "rules of Orthography, Etymology, or Prosody are transgressed; as, charus, for carus; stavi, for steti; tibicen, for\n",
      "tibicen.. :\n",
      "2. A SOLECISM is when the rules of Syntax are:\n",
      "transgressed ; as, Dicit libros lectos iri, for ledum iri : We\n",
      "was walking, for we were. A barbarism may consist in one\n",
      "word, but a solecism requires several words.\n",
      "3. An IDIOTISM is when the manner of expression peculiar to one language is used in another ; as an Anglicism\n",
      "in Latin, thus, I am to write, Ego sum scriběre, for ego sum\n",
      "scripturus ; It is I, Est ego, for Ego sum : Or a Latinism in\n",
      "English, thus, Est sapientior me, He is wiser than me, for\n",
      "than I; Quem dicunt me esse? Whom do they say that I\n",
      "am ? for who, &c.\n",
      "4. TAUTOLOGY is when we either uselessly repeat the\n",
      "same words, or repeat the same sense in different words.\n",
      "5. BOMBAST is when high sounding words are used\n",
      "without meaning, or upon a trifling occasion.\n",
      "6. AMPHIBOLOGY is when, by the ambiguity of the\n",
      "construction, the meaning may be taken in two different\n",
      "senses ; as in the answer of the oracle to Pyrrhus, Aio te;\n",
      "Facide, Romanos vincere posse. But the English is not so.\n",
      "liable to this as the Latin.\n",

      "V. FigurES OF RHETORIC.\n",
      "Certain modes of speech are termed Figurative, because\n",
      "they convey our meaning under a borrowed form, or in a\n",
      "particular dress.\"\n",
      "Figures (figurce or schemăta) are of two kinds ; figures\n",
      "of words, (figurae verborum,) and figures of thought, (figurue sententiarum.) The former are properly called Tropes;\n",
      "and if the word be changed, the figure is lost.\n",
      "1. TROPES, OR FIGURES OF Words.\n",
      "A Trope (conversio,) is an elegant turning of a word from\n",
      "its proper signification.\n",
      ". Tropes take their rise partly from the barrenness of language, but more from the influence of the imagination and\n",
      "passions. They are founded on the relation which one object bears to another, chiefly that of resemblance or similitude.\n",
      "The principal tropes are the Metaphor, Metonymy, Synecdoche, and Irony.\n",
      "1. METAPHOR (translatio) is when a word is transferred\n",
      "from that to which it properly belongs, to express something\n",
      "to which it is only applied from similitude or resemblance;\n",
      "as, a hard heart; a soft temper; he bridles his anger ; a\n",
      "joyful crop ; ridet ager, the field smiles, foc. A metaphor\n",
      "is nothing else but a short comparison.\n",
      "We likewise call that a metaphor, when we substitute\n",
      "one object in the place of another, on account of the close\n",
      "resemblance between them; as when, instead of youth, we\n",
      "say, the morning or spring time of life; or when, in speaking of a family connected with a common parent, we use the\n",
      "expressions which properly belong to a tree, whose trunk\n",
      "and branches are connected with a common root. When\n",
      "this allusion is carried on through several sentences, or\n",
      "through a whole discourse, and the principal subject kept\n",
      "out of view, so that it can only be discovered by its resemblance to the subject described, it is called an ALLEGORY.\n",
      "An example of this we have in Horace, book 1. ode 14.\n",
      "where the republic is described under the allusion of a ship.\n",
      "An ALLEGORY is only a continued metaphor. This\n",
      "figure is much the same with the Parable, which so often\n",
      "occurs in the sacred scriptures ; and with the Fable, such\n",
      "as those of Æsop. The Ænigma or Riddle is also con-\n",
      "\n",

      "Procerbs (Proverbia v. Adagia ;) thus, In sylvam ligna ferre,\n",
      "Horat.\n",
      "Metaphors are improper when they are taken from low\n",
      "objects; when they are forced or far-fetched; when they\n",
      "are mixed or too far pursued ; and when they have not a\n",
      "patural and sensible resemblance; or are not adapted to\n",
      "the subject of discourse, or to the kind of composition,\n",
      "whether poetry or prose.\n",
      "When a word is very much turned from its proper sig.\n",
      "dification, it is called \"Cutachrēsis (abrasio ;) as, a leaf of\n",
      "paper, of gold, &c. the empire flourished; parricida, for any\n",
      "murderer ; Vir gregi ipse caper, Virg. Altum ædificant caput, Juv. Hunc vobis deridendum propino, for trado, Ter.\n",
      "Eurus per Siculas equitavit undas, Hor...\n",
      "When a word is taken in two senses in the same phrase,\n",
      "the one proper and the other metaphorical, it is called Syllepsis, (comprehensio ;) as, Galatea thymo mihi dulcior Hyble,\n",
      "Virg. Ego sardois videar tibi amarior herbis, Id.\n",
      "2. METONYMY (inutatio nominis) is the putting of one\n",
      "name for another. In which sense it includes all other\n",
      "tropes ; but it is commonly restricted to the following\n",
      "particulars ; 1. When the cause is put for the effect ;\n",
      "or the inventor, for the thing invented; or the author for\n",
      "his works ; as, Bouin labores, for corn ; Mars, for war ;\n",
      "thus, Æquo murte pugnatuin est, with equal advantage, Liv.\n",
      "Ceres, for grain, or bread ; Bacchus, for wine; Venus, for\n",
      "love ; Vulcanus, for fire ; thus, Sine, Cerere & Baccho friget\n",
      "Venus, Ter. Furit Vulcanus, Virg. So a general is put for\n",

      "cor, vir cordatus, a man of sense, Plaut. But with us the\n",
      "heart is put for courage or affection, and the head for wisdom ; thus, a stout heart; a warm heart.; a sound head, &c.\n",
      "So, to have a well hung tongue, for to speak with ease, &c.\n",
      "When we put what follows to express what goes before,\n",
