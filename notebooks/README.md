# corppa demo notebooks

These Jupyter notebooks are provided with `corppa` to demonstrate
working with the poetry excerpt dataset generated by this codebase.

## Setup

To run locally, you need a python environment with corppa and related
dependencies installed.  See the [main readme](.../README.md) for instructions.

[todo: config file setup]

Run `jupyter-lab`, which should open in your web browser and allow
you to browse and run the notebooks in this folder.


## Automated checks

The notebooks in this folder are checked using a GitHub Actions workflow
that runs [treon](https://github.com/ReviewNB/treon) to confirm that
notebooks still run with any changes to the corppa code used in the notebook.

[todo: CI config setup]

To run locally:
```console
treon notebooks/
``
