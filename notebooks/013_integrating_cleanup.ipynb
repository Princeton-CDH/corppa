This is\\nnatural, since it represents the speech of one community, practically of\\none man. It is quite probable that the Gothic known to us has\\nyielded more to systemzwang than the language as spoken. Certainly\\nit reached a stage of development that the other dialects did not attain\\ntill much later. Hence it is that there are so few instances of “gram-\\nmatical change,\" and so many forms that have been largely influenced\\nby analogy. For example, instead of qumans the historically correct\\nform would have been *kumans, though this in turn goes back to a\\npre-Germanic *guumonos. And it is not improbable that qiman may\\nalso be of secondary formation for an original *kuman, which is seen\\nin O.S., O.E. cuman, O.N. koma. Cf. Sievers, PBB, VIII, 80 ff. Such\\nforms as O.H.G. gidungan from dwingan, with the disappearance of w\\nbefore u, or lārun froin lesan, are never met with in Gothic. The stage\\nof Gothic at the time of Ulfilas was reached later by O.H.G. when it\\nwrote gidwungan and lāsun. Consequently Gothic often has the\\nappearance of preserving older formations. This is not the case, how.\\never, wherever analogy has been a disturbing element.\\nWe must therefore expect to find in the workings of Verner\\'s Law\\na generalization in favor of either the surd or the sonant spirant. What\\nwe actually find is more frequently the former.\\nAccording to Verner\\'s Law there should be in Gothic an inter.\\nchange, in allied forms, of f-6, h-g, h-w, p-d, s-2. Since the inter-\\nchange of h-g brings in some points not raised by the interchange in\\nthe other cases, this will be treated by itself.\\n1. First then as to the development of nasal + guttural (whether\\nvelar or palatal) as affected by Verner\\'s Law, or not affected.\\nThe verb peihan, with which cf. Lith. tenkù, may be put in pre-\\nGermanic form as follows:\\n*tengo, *tetonqa, *tetņqmmé, *trgonós.\\nThis would have yielded in Gothic if undisturbed by analogy,–\\nþeiha, *pāh, * þungum, * þungans.\\n',\n",

So we have :\\nþeihan, þáih, þaihum, þaihans.\\nIn O.H.G. dihan went through the same process, but retained the\\n\"grammatical change,” giving:\\ndihan, dėh, digum, gidigan.\\nAs dwingan had originally the perf. part. gidungan, that may have\\nhelped to retire from use the * gidungan that belonged to dihan. In\\nO.S. thihan has the perf. part. githigan, and also the old irregular\\nform githungan.\\nIn O. E. we may suppose the following development:\\n*pihan, *põh, þungon, þungen,\\n*pihan, pāh, pigon, þigen,\\npion, pah, þugon,\\nWe have here forms belonging to three ablaut-series. These vari-\\nous forms, together with those in O.H.G. and in O.S. show that lev-\\neling had not taken place in Gerinanic.\\nWith this verb is connected the noun þeihs <1\\'teng (v.

In the other\\ndialects the development is different. The reason for this will be dis-\\ncussed later.\\nIn fāhan the h has spread to all the forms. O.H.G. has fāhan,\\nfiang, fiangum, gifangan. This more nearly represents the original\\nstate of affairs than the Gothic.\\nThe sing. pret. was more readily assimilated to the plural, because\\nthe vowel was the same. O.S. and O.E. have forms corresponding\\nto those of O.H.G. O.N. has occasionally in the pres. subj. fange\\nfor the regular fãe. This presupposes an inf. fanga, which is found in\\n0. Sw.\\nAn unnasalized form of this root occurs in Goth. fagrs, and in\\nO.H.G. fuogen, O.E. gefögan, and in M.H.G. vëgen.\\nThe verb hāhan is parallel in its development with fähan, except\\nthat in (). N. the inf. is always hanga.\\nThe noun hūhrus < * xúnxruz shows a difference in accent, as\\n',\n",

The weak verb huggrjan, as it had the accent on the suffix,\\nis regular in its development.\\nIn the Goth. juggs and jūhiza we have an instructive illustration, as\\nit shows that the comparative had the accent on the root-syllable, as\\nVerner pointed out. In O.N. occurs the same interchange: positive\\nungr, com. öre and the later yngre, superl. yngstr and once ārstr. The\\nlast form proves nothing for the superlative, since the r shows that it\\nwas modeled after the comparative like German mehrst. In O.H.G.\\nare jung, jūgiro, besides the usual jungiro. Kluge in Paul\\'s Grundr.,\\nI, 400, derives jugiro, which he writes with a short u, from *juwiza by\\nBugge\\'s Law, comparing it with Skt. yávīyāns. But Bugge\\'s Law\\nrequires the accent *juwiza to give jugiro, and that is authorized neither\\nby the Skt. accent nor by the z of the comparative in Germanic. It is\\nbetter therefore to explain it with Paul, in PBB, VI, 544, as a partial\\nassimilation from an original *jūhizo, so that it would be in line with\\nthe Goth. jūhiza and O.N. öre.\\nThe development of I.E. *penge, “five,\" is peculiar. It probably\\nrepresents an assimilation to *pempe, which regularly gave the Goth.\\nfimf. This assimilation doubtless took place before the Germanic sound-\\nshiſting, at any rate before the disappearance of the nasal before x,\\notherwise the Germanic form would have been *fix(ue) > Goth. *feih.\\nIn like manner *ppqtó- or *penqtó- would give Gothic *fūhta or\\n*feihta. In two words so closely allied the development would cer-\\ntainly be parallel. This, however, does not shut out the possibility of\\ndialectical variation. So Kauffman, PBB, XII, 512, basing his conclu-\\nsion on the *poqtó- set up by von Fierlinger, KZ, 27, p. 194, supposes\\na survival of the guttural in the Swabian fuchzen, 15, and fuchzk, 50,\\nand in fuft, etc. This view is supported by Brugmann, Grundr., II,\\n476.\\nNow it is certain that the same dialect would not retain the guttural\\nin the ordinal and change it to a labial in the cardinal. If these forms\\ngiven by Kauffmann could be historically traced to 0.H.G. there\\nwould be much better ground for supposing that the ch comes from\\nthe I.E. q. There seems to be a change here for which at present no\\nreason can be given, though it seems similar to the change in Low\\nGerman of ft>cht. And it is hardly necessary to hold to the presence\\nof ch in order to explain the disappearance of n, when we consider how\\nfrequently a nasal disappears before a spirant throughout the Upper\\nGerman.

That is, the nasalized i\" would more read-\\nily yield to the leveling process in restoring g from the forms in which\\nit was regular, than would a long pure i.\\nThe development of Goth. fin pan as compared with the same verb\\nin other dialects is instructive. Gothic has þ throughout, as we should\\nexpect. O.H.G. and O.N. in their older forms have the regular “gram-\\nmatical change.” O.S. has inf. fithan and findan. O.E. has findan,\\nfond, fundon, funden. Here, then, findan, fond have displaced *fiþan,\\n*foß, which did not become well enough established to produce a verb\\nof the first ablaut-series, but yielded to the analogy of fundon, funden.\\nBut to return to dringan, dwingan, and slingan. There is another\\nelement that has brought about a different treatment of these verbs\\nthan that of dihan. If we refer the g to an I.E. gh, as Noreen does in\\nhis Urg. Lautlehre, p. 146, in the case of slingan, then the difficulty is\\nremoved at a stroke. However, we will take his derivation given ibid.,\\np. 184, where, as given by others, he connects it with Lith, slenkù, and\\nwith O.N. slö<*slanho, O.H.G. slango, etc. O.H.G. dwingan, O.S.\\nthwingan, O.N. puinga, and O.H.G. dūhen, O.E. þön leave no doubt as\\nto their origin. The same is true of dringan compared with Goth.\\npreihan. Now O.N. furnishes evidence that slingan and dringan were\\naorist-presents, or at least that that formation existed by the side of\\nthe other. Besides the O.N. sing. pres. þryngr occurs þrongr<\\n* prangwiR< * træq-ési. The R in this instance does not prevent our\\nassuming the accent indicated, since leveling has brought in the same\\nending for all verbs, regardless of the original accent. Upon the form\\nprongr an infinitive prongua was made, and also an inf. sløngua from\\na presupposed * slongr, and these then are often conjugated weak.\\nFor sløngua 0. Sw. has slunga, a plain aorist-present formation.\\nSo then the ng in these verbs in all the dialects but Gothic is\\ndue to a suffix-accentuation, and the vowel that properly belongs to\\nan imperfect-present was introduced from the regular type. The\\nGoth. þreihan may be due to a by-form with root-accent, or may have\\ngeneralized the h from the sing. perf. O.H.G. dwingan, O.S. thwingan,\\netc., may also have been aorist-presents that have lost the semblance of\\nthat formation, or they may have been remodeled after the part. and\\nplur. perf.

Without leveling there\\nwould be “grammatical change\" as follows: (1) In imperfect-presents\\nthe surd spirant would occur in the pres. and in the sing. perf., the\\nsonant spirant in the plur. perf. and in the perf. part. (2) In aorist-\\npresents the surd spirant would occur in the sing. perf., the sonant\\nspirant in the plur. perf. and in the perf. part., and in the present.\\nFurthermore, in the endings affected by Verner\\'s Law, those of the\\nimperfect-presents would show the sonant spirant, the others the surd\\nspirant.\\nThe actual condition in Gothic is quite different. The personal\\nendings are those naturally developing in imperfect-presents. In all\\nimperfect-presents the surd spirant has been generalized. In aorist-\\npresents the sonant spirant has been generalized, though this cannot\\nbe known in all cases with certainty.

If we have a surd spirant, however, we need not necessarily\\nconclude that the verb represents an imperfect-present, though the\\npresumption is in its favor.

The Weak Verbs.—Since these verbs in most of their forms had\\nthe accent on the suffix, we should expect final f, h, b, b, s, of the root\\nto change to b, g, w, d, 2. But in most cases we do not find that. What\\nis the explanation ? Several have been given.\\nPaul in PBB, VI, 548, explains the s in hausjan, nasjan, etc., as a\\nfinal s, and hence falling under the general rule in Gothic. That this\\ncannot be is seen from the fact that b and d are not treated as finals\\nbefore -jan. E. g. arbaidjan, usbraidjan, usdaudjan, daubjan, draibjan,\\nbilaibjan, where d and b are treated the same as in arbaidai, bileiban.\\nIn most cases the true explanation is that Gothic has leveled the weak\\nverb to the corresponding strong verb or noun. This was the expla-\\nnation given by Verner, KZ, XXIII, 120. An examination of the weak\\nverbs in Gothic brings out this fact. Taking first the verbs with s before\\nthe suffix, we find that in almost every instance there are related words\\nwith s; and in no case is there a weak verb with s derived from, or\\nconnected with, a noun or strong verb with .. Hence kiusan : kausjan;\\nliusan, laus : lausjan; þaursus : þaursjan, etc. On the other hand the\\nverbs with 2 do have related forms with z, and do not have related\\nforms with s, with the possible exception of wizón, provided we connect\\nthat with wisan. The same is true with verbs in p. So daups, dau pis :\\ndauþjan. Verbs in d, with two exceptions, have either allied words\\nwith d, or at least none with Þ. The two exceptions are sandjan: sinps;\\nand fra-wardjan: wair pan. Leveling did not take place here, per-\\nhaps, because the connection was not felt.\\nWith f there are four verbs.

It is very seldom that variation occurs within the\\nsame word in Gothic:--guda, gu þa; unfrödans, unfröpans. The vari-\\nation h-ng was retained in two instances in related words, not in the\\nsame word, however.\\nIt is evident that there are words that owe their surd spirant not to\\na root-accent in the word itself, but to related words. For example,\\nthe h in hūhrus must be due to root-accent in some forms of that word,\\nfor there is no other source for it; but swaihrā was doubtless leveled\\nto swaihra.\\nThe variation that exists between Goth. alþeis and O.H.G. alt, O.S.\\nald, etc., is perhaps not original. Brugmann, Grundr. II, 126, sug-\\ngests the possibility that alþeis may have been modeled after niuji-s.\\nWe should expect *alps, gen. *aldis, since it is a to-participle to alan.\\nThe ” might have been generalized in Gothic from the comparative.\\nWe may suppose it was originally *alıás, *álþizas, (cf. O.H.G. elthiro,\\nO.N. ellre) *aldistás.\\nIn Goth. baúrþei: ga-baúrps (p) an original “ gram. change\" has\\nbeen abandoned that is preserved in W.G. Here we do not need to\\nsupppose that Goth. gabaurps represents a Germ. *gabúrpi-, since it\\nmay have been leveled to an allied form.\\nAnother instance of the same kind is Goth. dau pus : daups. Here\\nthe p of the latter word is probably due to that of the former.\\nSo too a sans may have preserved its s from analogy of asneis.\\nThe variation given above between Goth. fairzna and O.S. fersna,\\netc., is hardly due to accent. The Sanskrit accent together with the\\nW.G. forms points toward an original root-accent. Since the later\\nGermanic accent fell on the first syllable, Goth. fairzna would repre-\\nsent neither an I.E. nor a Germ. accent. Goth. faps (a) has not\\n',\n",

But the fact\\nremains that they have not reached their final solution, although the\\nwork of Karl Ljungstedt, Anmärkningar till det starka pret. i germ.\\nspråk, Upsala Universitets Årsskrift, 1888, has done much in that\\ndirection. Nearly all who have written on the subject have assumed\\nthat the Gothic represents the only regular development, and have\\nattempted to derive therefrom the forms in the W. and N.G.\\nSo Germanists have had the impossible task of explaining O.H.G.\\nskiad by Goth. skaiskaid, or O.H.G. leof, liuf by Goth. haihlaup.

Here again Grimm leads the way, Gk.\\' II, p. 72 ff.,\\nGesch. d. d. Spr., p. 598 ff., by pointing out that the reduplicating\\nverbs are derived from the ablauting verbs. Following closely in his\\ntrack Adolf Moller in a dissertation, Die red. Verba im D. als abge-\\nleitete Verba, Göttingen, 1865, shows pretty conclusively that there\\nwas some connection between the ablauting and the reduplicating\\nverbs. He says, p. 20 : “Sind, wie wir glauben, die reduplicirenden\\nVerba durch die wortbildende Kraft des deutschen Ablauts von den\\naublautenden Verben abgeleitet, so muss es ablautende Verba geben\\noder gegeben haben, aus welchen unsere reduplicirenden Verba ent-\\nstanden sind.\"\\nMøller failed, however, to follow up the suggestion of Grimm,\\nGesch. d. d. Spr. p. 603, who expresses the possibility that O.H.G. ia\\nin reduplicating verbs may have arisen, not from the contraction of an\\nolder reduplication, but from an original ablaut.\\nAs originally ablauting verbs Ljungstedt considers the reduplica-\\nting verbs, and as such they will be treated here, and an attempt will be\\nmade to explain how this ablaut arose.\\n',\n",

       "  'page_text': \"28\\nREDUPLICATING VERBS IN GERMANIC.\\nLet us see first wherein the old method of regarding the preterit of\\nreduplicating verbs as the result of contraction or analogy or both is\\na failure. Let us briefly review Hoffory's article, Die. red. Preterita\\nim An. KZ, 27, 593 ff.; for this is the most ingenious that has been writ-\\nten from that standpoint on “unstreitig eins der schwierigsten capitel\\nder deutschen grammatik.” The preterit vowel he explains by a process\\nof reduction and contraction and analogy. This process is due to a\\nchange of accent. For example, the development of O.N. fell is given\\nthus : *féfall > *fefáll > *feféll > *ffell > fell.\\nNow if the accent *féfall had existed there would hardly have\\narisen an accent *fofáll, for that would be contrary to the Germanic ten-\\ndency. It is also contrary to what we find in 0.E. heht, leolc, leort,\\ndreord; for these forms could arise only under an accent on the redu-\\nplicating syllable. And as the preterit vowel is practically the same\\nin N. and W.G., we must assume that it had a common origin. Fur-\\nthermore there is evidence that the root syllable of the pret. bore the\\naccent. This is seen from O.N. hell < *help, fell < *felp, sera <\\n*sezó', snera < snező', and Goth. saizlēp. It is evident therefore that\\nhelt and felt can have no place in Hoffory's scheme, since they are later\\nanalogical formations, helt being for *held, and the d arising from the\\nplur. heldom.\\nIf now we abandon this method of explaining the preterit vowel by\\ncontraction and analogy, and see what we really have, we shall find\\na practical agreement on the part of the N. and W.G., that points\\ntoward a well established ablaut. We shall further see that there are\\nforms that can be brought in agreement with the Gothic redupli-\\ncated preterits. This means that Germanic had more than one past\\ntense for these verbs. That the perfect is not the only past tense\\nrepresented in Germanic has been recognized in several instances\\nby different scholars. For a summary of such instances compare\\nLjungstedt, Anm. till det starka pret., p. 3 f., and Kluge, Paul's\\nGrundr. I, 375.\\nNow what I suppose to be the origin of the so-called reduplicating\\nverbs is briefly this: Many of these verbs had the accent originally on\\nthe suffix. This caused a reduction of the root-vowel and a consequent\\nsimilarity to the perfect, as will be seen later. These verbs therefore\\nretained the reduplication in the perfect and also expressed past time\\nby another tense having a different ablaut. Gothic, at least the Gothic\\nthat has come down to us, always made use of this reduplicated per-\\nfect. The N. and W.G., while retaining in a number of examples\\n\",\n",

In its reduced form it would appear in Ger-\\nmanic as ai, i, i. Cf. besides the references given above, Persson,\\nWurzelerweiterung, p. 117. Verbs with this diphthong when not\\naccented on the suffix would fall together with verbs of the first ablaut-\\nseries. For this class arose the ablaut: (1) aį ; (2) < < ēj; (3) ai <\\noị; (4) aį. (1) ai, which is the middle grade, is found in the present, (3)\\nai, which developed from the shortened diphthong oị < oj, in the per-\\nfect, and (4) ai, likewise reduced from ēj, in the pret. part.\\nAnd to what tense shall we assign (2) é? There are two possibili-\\nties. It may be an imperfect of the normal type. That is, we may\\nsuppose that there existed a present of the normal type by the\\nside of an aorist-present, as Gk. τρέπω and τράπω, τέμνω and τάμνω, or\\n0.H.G. firspirnit and spurnu. In the present the aorist-present\\ncrowded out the normal type, but the normal type remained in the\\nimperfect, because it was only through this type that there could be a\\ndifference of ablaut. That is as if the Greek had said rpórw but\\nétpetov. Another possibility would be a root-aorist like Skt. chedam\\nfrom chid. This method of forming the tenses applies to the other\\nclasses as well as this.\\nIt shall next be our task to show what authority there is for assum-\\ning for verbs of this class a root with ēį.\\nPersson, Wurzelerweiterung, p. 119, sets down under the root\\n(s)mē-Į Goth. aiza-smi-pa, O.H.G. smid, smeidar, mei-zan, mei-zil, Goth.\\nmai-tan. · To the root mē-i, “ to think,” cf.

O.H.G. sweifan and sweben seem to be\\nrelated, and this sets sweifan < Germ. *swaipan into the e-series. To\\nskaidan belong 0.H.G. scit, O.E. scide, prov. Eng. shide, and also O.H.G.\\nscizan. These go back to an I.E. root skheit, srhějd. To the same root\\nbelong Skt. chid, Gk. oxícw, Lat. scindo.

In the double forms given\\nabove, O.H.G. wallan and wellan, etc., it is impossible to say whether\\nthe forms with ë are restorations of the normal type, or whether both\\ngo back to original double forms. The latter is perhaps most fre-\\nquently the case.\\n· The vowel of the pret. formed from the imperf. is ë, as 0.N., O.S,\\nand O.E., as well as O.Fr. and M.L.Franc. show. Before ntcons. this\\nvowel would become i. Such we find it in O.N., with later e, and gen-\\nerally in O.Fr. and M.L.Franc. In O.N. the ia, io found in such\\nforms as hialp, fiollo are the result of breaking. See Noreen, Aisl.\\nGram. p. 60 ff. The ia of 0.H.G. is after the analogy of skiad, of\\nClass I and riat of Class IV. The forms kenc, fenc, etc., point toward\\nan earlier *held, *feld, etc., after which they were modeled. The forms\\nintphiec, intphiegum may have arisen, as Paul, PBB, VI, 544 suggests, .\\nfrom a partial assimilation. The development would be *finx > *fih>\\n*fig > fiec. O.H.G. erren is the only verb of this class with r, though\\nthis is purely accidental. It may have been added to this class entirely\\nby analogy, or may really go back, in its pre-Germanic form, to a root\\ncontaining e. Cf. Goth. airpa, O.H.G. erda and ero, O.E. corpe and\\neard (< *ar-tós), Gk. čp-age. O.S. geng, feng, etc., owe their e for i to\\nthe other verbs, which regularly have e. The ie, which occasionally\\noccurs, arose as the 0.H.G. ia.\\nIn O.E. the a of the pres. becomes o before n, and is broken to ea\\nbefore l+cons. The vowel of the pret. (imperf.) was e, which it has\\nremained in blend, heng, etc., for an older *blind, *hing, etc. The force\\nof analogy is very apparent here, since in 0.E. ë before nasals even\\nwhen not followed by a consonant becomes i. The eo in verbs with\\n1+cons. is the result of breaking ; in beonn, speonn, geong after the\\nanalogy of these.

It would\\nthen be exactly parallel with the others. The al, an of the pres., plur.\\nperf., and part. pret. could then represent I.E. al, an <ol, on. This\\ngives the best explanation of the al, an of the plur. perf., where we\\nshould expect ul, un. This does occur rarely, and may be after the\\nanalogy of verbs of ablauting Class III, or be the regularly developed\\nlowest grade !, n. This would also explain the al, an of the part. pret.\\nThe el, in of the pret. (imperf.) would go back to pre-Germanic el, en\\nfrom I.E. él, én. So Streitberg, Zur germ. Sprachgeschichte, p. 71,\\nwould be right in his surmise that the e in the pret. of these verbs\\ncomes from a long vowel. He is wrong, however, in the way he under-\\nstands the development here.\\nTo begin with the e of the O.N. fekk, O.E. feng, Isidor\\'s feng goes\\nback to an original i, as the O.N. plainly shows, and this i was again\\nchanged (though not in O.N. till comparatively late) after the analogy\\nof felt, helt, etc. So, of course, the e in fekk, felt, etc., does not go\\nback to Germ. če (< I.E. e), since the I.E. è in this position was short-\\nened, as he points out, but it may very well go back to I.E. ė, and the\\ndevelopment would be the same as in 0.H.G. fersana < *pe\\'rsnā, and\\nof wint < *uèntós.\\nTo the fourth class of reduplicating verbs, type slēpan and lētan,\\nbelong verbs with de in the pres., followed by a vowel or a single conso-\\nnant. There is no evidence here that the accent was on the suffix. In\\nfact, O.N. blāsa, O.H.G. bläsan, Goth. blêsan point the other way, though\\nthis is not conclusive, since there is no “gram. change\" in the verb.\\nIn Gothic the perf. of slēpan has a different ablaut from that of\\nlētan. In the other dialects this difference is not so apparent, yet it\\nhas not entirely disappeared. E. g., O.N. sera < *sezó\\' has the same\\nablaut as Goth. saiso and Gk. čwka. Similarly E.N. lot, Goth. lailot;\\nbut O.Sw. lāt, grāt with the vowel of saíslēp. O.N. lēt has still another\\nvowel, viz. Germ. ė <ēļ. We may set up, therefore, the following\\nscheme for this class :\\nI.E. (1) é, (2) èį, (3) è, 7, (4) ė.\\nGerm. (1) ă, (2) é, (3) é, o, (4) ū.\\n',\n",

But the two cases are not par-\\nallel. In Goth. snaiws, aiw, the ai is a real diphthong; but in saian,\\nwaian the ai represents I.E. . Cf. Bremer, PBB, XI, 51 ff. That is,\\nO.E. blāwe (for * blāwu) comes from an earlier *blāu, and that, it is\\nsupposed, from *blāju> *blājö> * bhl-e-jo. The w in O.E. is a tran-\\nsition sound, which could not have developed while ; stood between\\nthe vowels. But in these verbs there is no trace of a ;. There is no\\nevidence that jever disappeared between vowels in ().E. before caus-\\ning umlaut.
