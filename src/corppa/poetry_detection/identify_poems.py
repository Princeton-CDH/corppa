"""

Script to identify poem excerpts by matching against a local
collection of reference poems.

Setup:

Download and extract poetry-ref-data.tar.bz2 from /tigerdata/cdh/prosody/poetry-detection
You should extract it in the same directory where you plan to run this script.
The script will compile reference content into full-text and metadata parquet files;
to recompile, rename or remove the parquet files.
