# Passim Pipeline
This directory contains the various scripts needed for running Passim
to detect the reuse of poetry on pages from works in PPA.

## Preliminary Passim Workflow

### 1. Create input corpora for `passim`
The pipeline requires one or more corpus JSONL files formatted for Passim.
The script `create_passim_corpus.py` will transform a given text corpus
JSONL file into a new format suitable for passing to Passim.

Minimally, for each record (i.e. line) the follow three fields are created:
1. `id`: The working id for the text record (e.g. ppa page or reference poem id).
         This is derived from the input record's `id` field. Optionally, this can
         be set to an alternative record field.
2. `corpus`: The corpus name the text record belongs to. This is provided as
             input to `create_passim_corpus.py`.
3. `text`: The record's text derived from the input record's `text` field.

Optionally, all other fields of the input records may be preserved by including the
`--preserve-fields` flag.

Example usage:
```
python create_passim_corpus.py ppa_pages.jsonl ppa-pages-passim.jsonl ppa
python create_passim_corpus.py poems.jsonl ref-poems.jsonl ref-poems
```

### 2. Run `passim`
Then, we can run `passim` using the `run_passim.py` script. Note that passim requires
Java 8\*/11/17. The script has the following required arguments:
- `--ppa-corpus`: A PPA corpus file (JSONL) produced in step 1
- `--ref-corpus`: A reference corpus (JSONL) produced in step 1; can be repeated to
                  specify multiple
- `--output-dir`: Pathname to the top-level output directory for passim results

Note that this will compare PPA texts (`corpus = "ppa"`) with texts from other sources
(`corpus != "ppa"`)

Example usage:
```
python run_passim.py --ppa-corpus passim-ppa.jsonl --ref-corpus passim-ref.jsonl --output-dir passim-output
env PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH" python run_passim.py --ppa-corpus ppa.jsonl --ref-corpus refa.jsonl --ref-corpus refb.jsonl --output-dir passim-output
```

#### Optional parameters
This script can also take several optional arguments that can be passed along to passim.
They are:
- `--max-df`: The upper limit on document frequency for ngrams
- `--min-match`: The minimum number of n-gram matches between documents
- `--ngram-size`: The size of n-gram to use
- `--floating-ngrams`: Allow n-grams to float from word boundaries
- `--gap`: The minimum gap size that separates passages
- `--min-align`: The minimum length of alignment

### 3. Build page-level results from `passim` output
After running `passim`, we can use the `get_passim_page_results.py` script to build
the page-level passages identified by `passim` in a JSONL file. This will include records
for pages where `passim` identifies *no* reuse.

The intended use cases of this output are two-fold:
1. Analysing and evaluting the performance of passim
2. Extracting the excerpts identified by passim

Currently, this script has two effective modes. One which includes the underlying text
excerpts and one that does not. This is due to the fact that `passim` output files do not
contain the full excerpts themselves, only an aligned version (one that includes "-" symbols
to indicate places where a character was "inserted" for alignment).

#### Get page-level `passim` results without excerpts
Currently, the default case does not include excerpts in the output JSONL file. It requires
the following arguments:
- `input_corpus`: The input corpus containing PPA texts used in in the passim run
- `passim_output_dir`: The passim output directory for the passim run
- `output`: Filename for the output page-level results (JSONL)

Example usage:
```
python get_passim_page_results.py ppa_passim.jsonl passim-output passim_page_results.jsonl
```

#### Get page-level `passim` results with excerpts
To include the full excerpt texts, the `--include-excerpts` flag must be set. Additionally,
any reference corpus files (JSONL) used in the passim run must be provided using the
`--ref-corpus` optional argument.

Example usage:
```
python get_passim_page_results.py ppa_text.jsonl passim-output passim_page_results.jsonl \
   --include-excerpts --ref-corpus ref_poems.jsonl
```

### 4. Build excerpt-level results
Finally, an excerpt-level results file (TSV) can be built from the page-level results
*with excerpts* built in the previous step using `get_passim_excerpts.py`.

```
python get_passim_excerpts.py passim_page_results.jsonl passim_excerpts.tsv
```
